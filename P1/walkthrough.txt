P1 objectives :
- Have a VM (Ubuntu based) ready for GNS3 use with Docker images
- Have 2 Docker images (1 host, 1 router)
- Have a simple GNS project setup with 1 host and 1 router

P1 steps :
1) Setup the VM with a custom made bash script that :
	- installs GNS3
	- installs Docker

2) Create 2 Dockerfiles for our 2 desired Docker images :
	- 1 for the host (based on a basic alpine image)
	- 1 for the router (based on a frrouting image, to easily and natively handle routing protocols)

3) Build the 2 Docker images from the Dockerfiles through a custom made bash script

4) Open GNS3 preferences menu (Ctrl+Shift+P) and create 2 Docker container templates with base images host:latest and router:latest

Config for the host :
	- name : host_LOGIN
	- number of adapters : 1
	- leave rest by default

Config for the router :
	- name : router_LOGIN
	- number of adapters : 2
	- leave rest by default
	- (Optionally) edit the template :
		- change category to "Routers"
		- change symbol to route_switch_processor

Apply the config and select OK

5) Drag and drop one host and one router on the main screen and start all nodes (PLAY icon)

6) Connect to the running host and router (TERMINAL icon)

You may have to change the default console connection application if you don't have gnome-terminal

If the terminal is unresponsive for the router, launch the auxiliary terminal(right click on the router and select the auxiliary terminal)

Finally, launch ps on both containers, and voila !
