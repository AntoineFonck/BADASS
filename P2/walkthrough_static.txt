FIRST STEP : Static VXLAN configuration --> no multicast

Objectives :
VXLAN set up statically (host_1 and host_2 can communicate at L2 level)

This workshop introduces a problem :
How to make VTEPs know about each other, and about the hosts to which they are physically connected ?

Well, VTEPs, by default, learn associations dynamically.

For instance :
1) Host1 sends a frame meant for Host2 to VTEP1.
2) VTEP1 knows that Host2 is behind VTEP2, so it forwards the frame to VTEP2.
3) VTEP2 analyzes the frame, and forwards it to Host2.
Before, VTEP2 didn't know Host1 was behind VTEP1, and now it knows it thanks to this frame.

Host1 --> VTEP1 --> VTEP2 --> Host2

All those associations are stored in the FDB (Forwarding DataBase) of the VTEP.

In the FDB, you find the following associations :
MAC address - network interface (for local devices, e.g. 42:42:42:42:42:42 eth1)
MAC address - IP of the master VTEP (for non-local devices, e.g. DE:AD:BE:EF:DE:AD 42.42.42.3)

But VTEPs can never learn if they don't receive anything.

So, the easiest solution is to statically link VTEPs in the FDB.
Basically, if a VTEP receives a frame meant for a device it doesn't know, and is behind an other VTEP, it will forward the frame via VXLAN to the hardcoded VTEP in the FDB.
The entry in the FDB will look like this :

(wildcard MAC)		(VTEP_IP)
00:00:00:00:00:00	42.42.42.3

We will statically configure the 2 VTEPs so that they don't need to learn about each other dynamically with multicast
