FIRST STEP : Static VXLAN configuration --> no multicast

Objectives :
VXLAN set up statically

For our VXLAN to work, we need :
2 VTEP (our switches/routers) that can communicate with each other over IP and UDP.
They also need to know about each other at L2 level, through their FDB (Forwarding DataBase).
The FDB will remember all hosts by their MAC addresses behind every VTEP.

This first configuration is easy, because the 2 VTEPs are directly connected to each other.

We will statically configure the 2 VTEPs so that they don't need to learn about each other dynamically with multicast

Router configuration :
R1
eth1 conf
# Set IP for the outside-facing interface (the one connecting to the other VTEP)
ip addr add 42.42.42.1/24 dev eth1
VXLAN/eth0 conf
# Set IP for the inner-facing interface (the one simulating the LAN switch)
ip addr add 192.168.42.1/24 dev eth0
# Set VXLAN interface and statically indicate where the other VTEP is
ip link add vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 dstport 4789 local 42.42.42.1 remote 42.42.42.2
ip link set vxlan10 up
# Bridge the inner-facing interface and the VXLAN interface
ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up
ip link set vxlan10 master br0
ip link set eth0 master br0

R2
# Set IP for the outside-facing interface (the one connecting to the other VTEP)
ip addr add 42.42.42.2/24 dev eth1
VXLAN/eth0 conf
# Set IP for the inner-facing interface (the one simulating the LAN switch)
ip addr add 192.168.42.254/24 dev eth0
# Set VXLAN interface and statically indicate where the other VTEP is
ip link add vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 dstport 4789 local 42.42.42.2 remote 42.42.42.1
ip link set vxlan10 up
# Bridge the inner-facing interface and the VXLAN interface
ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up
ip link set vxlan10 master br0
ip link set eth0 master br0
