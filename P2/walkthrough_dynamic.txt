SECOND STEP : Dynamic VXLAN configuration --> IP multicast

Objectives :
VXLAN set up dynamically, via an IP multicast group (host_1 and host_2 can communicate at L2 level)

This time, instead of hardcoding for each VTEP the other VTEP's IP address, we will use a single IP multicast group.

The concept is pretty basic :
The VTEPs don't know each other's addresses, only a special IP --> the multicast group (239.1.1.1 in our case).
Thanks to multicast, they will alert each other that they belong to the same group to do VXLAN (by using a protocol called IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)).
This way, when a VTEP has to forward a frame to an other unknown VTEP, it will just send the packet to all VTEPs that "subscribed" to the multicast group (239.1.1.1).

This brings flexibility into our configuration, especially if we start adding more VTEPs.

For instance :
If we added a VTEP3, and continued using the static configuration, we would have to :
	- update VTEP1 by hardcoding VTEP3's IP address as a VXLAN destination
	- update VTEP2 by hardcoding VTEP3's IP address as a VXLAN destination
	- set up VTEP3 by hardcoding VTEP1 and VTEP2's IP addresses as VXLAN destinations

However, if we used a dynamic configuration, we would only have to :
	- set up VTEP3 to be a member of the multicast group we created (239.1.1.1)
