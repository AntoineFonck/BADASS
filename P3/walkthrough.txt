THIRD PART : VXLAN with BGP EVPN control plane

Objective : 
Integrate the BGP EVPN control plane to our VXLAN network

In the third and final part of the project, we have to implement using BGP EVPN as a control plane for our datacenter relying on VXLAN.

In our BPG EVPN/VXLAN infrastructure:
	- The VTEPs are the PEs
	- The hosts are the CEs
	- The RR will reflect all routes announced by the VTEPs/PEs

The VTEPs will automatically learn about their local hosts MAC addresses (which is fine).
But VTEPs will learn about remote hosts MAC addresses via BGP EVPN.

We will use a RR, so that the FDB of our VTEPs will synchronize automatically.

We are asked to use the loopback interfaces of our VTEPs and RR for the iBGP sessions.
This is a common good practice, as loopback interfaces never go down, and can have multipe paths to be reachable from.
This way, iBGP sessions don't go down if one physical link is down but another one is up.

However, we cannot route directly between loopback interfaces.

So in order to achieve this practice, we have to use an IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol - so basically a routing protocol made to be used in a single AS).
The IGP is used to establish the iBGP session (TCP session) between the VTEPs and the RR.

In our case, we will use OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as an IGP.

So to make all of that clear, here's how things will happen once we integrate the BGP EVPN control plane to our VXLAN network :
	1) VTEP1 has 1 local host (Host1), and VTEP2 also has 1 local host (Host2), VTEP1 and VTEP2 are both connected to a Route Reflector.
	2) VTEP1 and VTEP2 automatically learn about the MAC addresses of their respective local hosts
	3) VTEP1 and VTEP2 forward this information to the Route Reflector via BGP routes
	4) The Route Reflector reflects both routes back to VTEP1 and VTEP2
	5) Now that VTEP1 and VTEP2 have all the information they need about each other, Host1 and Host2 can communicate
