BGP EVPN for dummies

1) What is the control plane/data plane? 
2) What is a VPN?
3) What is BGP?
4) What is EVPN?
5) How does BGP EVPN relate to VXLAN?

--------------------------------------------------

1) What is the control plane/data plane?

WARNING: Both terms are conceptual, and do not relate to specific protocols. Their goal is to abstract and categorize complicated network topologies.

The CONTROL PLANE in a network refers to all functions and processes that determine HOW packets should be forwarded.
For instance, a router sharing connectivity information to another router through BGP.

The DATA PLANE in a network refers to all functions and processes that ACTUALLY FORWARD the packets (based on information given through the control plane).
For instance, a router forwarding a packet after checking its routing table.

2) What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that extends a private network, by creating a virtual link between this private network and another one, usually through tunneling.

Remote access VPN:
	A well known use case it to let clients connect to a private network to which they do not originally belong.
	For instance: a company VPN that lets workers connect to the company's internal network through the internet, allowing them to work from home.

Other use cases include:
Site-to-site VPN:
	Connecting two private networks (e.g. the regional Scranton branch to the New-York based Corporate) between each other. This connection may run over another network, like the internet.

Even a VLAN can be considered as a VPN.
Indeed, it provides virtual private interconnection between clients.

Common terminologies used in VPN topologies:

Customer device (C): Any client device not directly connected to the VPN provider

Customer Edge device (CE): Any client device directly connected to the VPN provider

Provider Edge device (PE): Any VPN provider device directly connected to the CE

Provider device (P): Any VPN provider device not directly connected to the CE


EXAMPLE use of those terms:
In a VLAN:
The switch is a PE.
Client hosts are CE.

3) What is BGP (RFC 4271) ?

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the routing protocol powering the internet.

The internet is a network composed of independant networks.
We call those independant networks "AS" (Autonomous System(s)).

One AS is usually under the control of a single company/organization.
An AS is composed of one or several public IP range(s).

BGP is used by routers to connect multiple AS to each other.

eBGP (exterior BGP) is used by routers between two AS.
iBGP (interior BGP) is used by routers inside a single AS (usually only to forward eBGP routes troughout a single network).

When routers use BGP under the same ASN (Autonomous System Number), they automatically use iBGP.

4) What is EVPN (RFC 7432) ?

EVPN (Ethernet Virtual Private Network) is a BGP-based "control plane" for layer 2 AND layer 3 VPNs.
It's cool because it works with many different "data plane" encapsulation protocols, including VXLAN...
It's pretty modern (the official RFC came out in February 2015).

By default, BGP can only be used to carry and share IPv4 routes. Therefore, it wouldn't work as a control plane for VXLAN, as we also need to share layer 2 reachability information: the hosts' MAC addresses...
To solve that problem, EVPN uses extensions of BGP to work, the MP-BGP extensions (RFC 4760).
More precisely, EVPN defines a new type of Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) to MP-BGP --> L2VPN EVPN. 

NLRI is a BGP field sent in a BGP message. Inside is all the interesting information (usually IPv4 routes) that routers will use and share.

This new type of NLRI is super convenient for VXLAN, as it carries everything needed so that VTEPs can easily learn about remote hosts.
Inside the new NLRI, you can put stuff like:
	- Host IP
	- Host MAC address
	- VXLAN Network ID
	- ...

In EVPN, devices called Provider Edge (PE) provide virtual Layer 2 connectivity between Customer Edge (CE) devices.
PEs advertise the MAC addresses learned from the CEs that are connected to them.

With VXLAN, VTEPs are the PE, and Hosts are the CE.

All in all, BGP EVPN is an elegant solution to handle a single or multiple VXLAN network(s).
Basically, it brings a solid control plane to VXLAN, which lacks one by default.

More precisely, BGP EVPN is a solution for VTEPs to avoid :
	- using multicast or hardcoded IPs to reach other VTEPs
	- learning dynamically about hosts behind VTEPs (by analyzing incoming packets, which can also cause a security risk if an attacker sends a fake REAL_SERVER_MAC:ATTACKER_VTEP_IP association to a victim VTEP. See here for full details: https://connect.ed-diamond.com/MISC/misc-110/securite-de-l-implementation-standard-de-vxlan (FR)).

By solving these two problems, we can achieve large scale and resilient VXLAN infrastructure deployments.
